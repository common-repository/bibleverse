Find and embed Bible verses directly onto your blog.  This app adds a Bible icon to your Wordpress editor.  It also automatically finds Bible references on all your posts and converts them to links.

== Description ==
This is the most advanced Bible plug-in on Wordpress that lets you search for and embed passages directly onto your blog posts.  Your Wordpress toolbar will have a new icon that lets you search for and add the passage directly to your post.  No more loading up a 3rd party site like BibleGateway.com or opening up your Bible to get the right chapter and verse.  

Also, the functionality of Scripturizer has been built in.  So you just continue blogging and all posts past, present and future with Bible references in them will be linked to the actual reference.  

Thanks to Scripturizer for the inspiration.  And ChurchTechMatters.com for thoroughly testing.
